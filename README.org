Defines a class =bolParser= which identifies the bol based on the hard
coded taal dictionary. This is an arbitrary design decision, and can be 
stored as a json if it has to be accessed by other modules.

When a =bolParser= object is initialized with a string defining 
a tukda, the string is parsed and the taal is identified, and the individual
akshars, vibhaags, and avartans are stored.
